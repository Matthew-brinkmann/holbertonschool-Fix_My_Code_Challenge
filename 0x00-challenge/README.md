# :hammer: Fix my code Challange
## By Matthew Brinkmann
Fix my code is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!   
Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.
```
The repository [0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) contains the original code with the errors.
```
Very little is recoded, just changing small parts of the code to fix the errors.   
### :speak_no_evil: About the languages
There is a mixture of C, Python, Ruby and JS. However deep understanding of the languages was not required, but more an understanding of code flow to solve the problems.
